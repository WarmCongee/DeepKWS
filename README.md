## Introduction

Code reproduction of the paper [Small-footprint keyword spotting using deep neural networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6854370). The codes is completed during ASLP Internship.

## Net Performance

This method modifies the network structure on the basis of the original paper, optimizes the network and obtains better results
